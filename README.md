# cs23
Repository for my past CS23 work at Cabrillo College. This course was a discrete mathematics course geared for computer science students. We used Python to represent discrete math topics. View readme for details on each assignment. We were given accounts on the school's server and the accounts are wiped at the end of each semester, so the instructions for these assignments are long gone, as are any internal files used such as the dictionaries for as01 and the programs for as10.
# Assignments
* [as01.py](as01.py): A set-based spell checker. Uses dictionary files (which I do not have access to anymore, unfortunately) to compare input text to. Any words not found in these dictionaries are printed to the console and determined to be "misspelled." 
* as03.py: A truth table generator. Given a postfix (p = q would turn into p q =, for example) propositional statement, generates a truth table for that statement.
* as04.py: Evaluates a propositional logic statement. Adds onto as03 to generate an internal truth table, then evaluates the critical rows of that truth table (the rows in which all all premises are true). If the conclusion for any of these critical rows is false, the argument is considered logically false. If all critical rows are true, the argument is considered logically sound. 
* as08.py: Evaluates given relations to test for various properties. This assignment is well commented, so refer to the file itself for more details.
* as10.py: Given a program which accepts some data, run it with n data and then run it with 4n data to determine its runtime curve. 
* as11.py: Similar to as08, given a function determines if it conforms to certain properties of functions.
# Conclusion
This class was an interesting take on discrete math. Not only did it teach me important discrete math topics, it also helped me become a better programmer. Considering how many colleges teach this course in a traditional math oriented way, I am very glad to have taken it at Cabrillo with Jeff (https://jeff.cis.cabrillo.edu/).
